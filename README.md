## 📽️ Project Overview

This project explores the capabilities and limitations of Visual Language Models (VLMs) in understanding dynamic scenes from video input. Our main objective is to evaluate how VLMs perceive context, objects, and relationships in scenes — and how factors such as resolution, framing, and prompting influence results.

The video used for this demo is:

## 🧠 Objective

- Set up an end-to-end pipeline for running inference on a VLM with video frame input
- Understand what makes a VLM output correct and complete
- Explore limitations based on:
  - Frame selection (early, middle, late)
  - Input resolution and crop variations
  - Prompt formulation strategies
